An implementation of the Bee Colony Optimization algorithm.

# Bee Colony Optimization Algorithm
The Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior 
of honeybees. 
It belongs to the class of swarm intelligence algorithms, where a group of agents collaboratively searches
for solutions to optimization problems.

The solutions to the problem are considered as potential food sources, 
and the algorithm iteratively refines these solutions to find the optimal or near-optimal solution.

BCO has been applied to various optimization problems, 
including function optimization, scheduling, routing, and other combinatorial optimization tasks. 

Its effectiveness lies in its ability to balance exploration and
exploitation through the collaboration of artificial agents,
mimicking the foraging behavior of bees in a colony.
